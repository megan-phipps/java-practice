		//What is an ArrayList and when to use it
		//When you need to change size
		//Comes with many useful manipulation methods. Not all of these are in Arrays
			//ArrayList only works with objects and wrapper classes only, not primitives
		//Learned how to use arrayList in custom methods
		
	//Object Oriented Java 
		//4 principles in Java:
		  //Encapsulation
		  //Inheritance
		  //Abstraction
		  //Polymorphism
	
	//Before learning OOP principles, we need to go over custom classes. So far we have used 
    //build in classes and created objects from them, ex: 
		//String, Scanner, Random, Arrays, ArrayList, Collections, Integer + other wrapper classes, System, etc...
	
	
	//So far we have covered Non-Object oriented programming / Imperative Programming
		//variables, conditions, loops, arrays, arrayList, String manipulation, data types
		
	//next we will focus on custom classes 
		
	//What is class vs. object?
		//CLASS is like a template / blueprint where we define 2 things
			// 1) data/variables/properties
				  //instance variables
			// 2) behavior/methods
		//OBJECT is created from a CLASS. It is an instance of a class
		
		//student class:
			//properties/data:
				//name, are, gender, email, class
			//behavior:
				//attend class, study
