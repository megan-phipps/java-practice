		//Just a value, not an object. Does not have any behavior
		
		//In java, for each primitive type, there is a matching class type. 
			//We call them Wrapper class
		
		//byte   --> Byte (wrapper classes )
		//short  --> Short
		//int    --> Integer is a wrapper class
		//long   --> Long
		//float  --> Float
		//double --> Double
		//boolean--> Boolean
		//char   --> Character
		
		//why do we need them?
			//Wrapper classes are used to convert a primitive into an object
		//Will have behavior and value at the same time. 
		//Wrapper classes also provide useful methods
		//We can only use wrapper classes with collections other than arrays
		
		//Objects can be created from classes
